  Then navigate to the `terminal_hack` directory

    cd hack_CLI/terminal_hack
  
  To install the required packages run `pip` for Windows and `pip3` for Mac

    pip install -r requirements.txt
  or
  
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
Now run the game

    python terminal_hack.py
  or

    python3 terminal_hack.py

## Playing the Game
  The game uses the `TAB` key to autocomplete commands. Also, use `UP Arrow` and `DOWN Arrow` to navigate command history.
